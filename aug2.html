<h2>
<p>Dimmer Automations</p>
</h2>


<!-- details -->
<p>
	<p>In Lightcloud, an automation is a rule you can set up to have the system perform a specific action when something happens. Typically, this involves one Lightcloud component telling another component to do something. For example, if you have a Ceiling Sensor in occupancy mode, you can configure it to turn on the lights when someone walks into the room. In addition, however, you can create automations to turn on lights in other zones. As another example, if you have a Lightcloud Daylight, you can create automations to dim one or more zones when the light level exceeds a certain foot-candle level.</p>

	<p>Today's release brings timer automations to the Lightcloud Dimmer.</p>

	<p>Why, might you ask, do I need this? Consider the example of a nurse’s station that is always occupied. You want the default dim level to be 50%, but for emergencies the nurse should be able to hit the top button on the switch to bring it up to 100%. Also, you want it to dim back down to 50% after 10 minutes.</p>

	<p>Setting this up is easy. First, click on the Dimmer device you want to set up.</p>

	</p>

	<p>Next, set the top Dimmer button to a scene that turns the zone on to 100%. Configure the bottom button to a scene that turns the zone off.
	</p>

	<p>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img src="../images/release_notes/aug_2/1.png" id="num_1_2">
		</div>
	</p>
	<p>Click Add under Automations. Create a rule which says that 10 minutes after the top button is pressed, a scene is activated that dims the Nurse’s Station to 50%. Then, click Save:</p>

	<p>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img src="../images/release_notes/aug_2/2.png" id="num_1_3">
		</div>
	</p>

	<p>With that, you’re all set! The top button will bring the lights up to 100%, and ten minutes later they will dim to 50%.</p>

<h2>
<p>New Energy Usage Graph</p>
</h2>


<!-- details -->
<p>
	<p>The second new feature in this release is a new graph in the Energy view that shows you the dim level for given zone over the past week. The graph lets you view usage patterns, confirm that scenes and schedules are being applied as intended, and show you where you can apply additional lighting control techniques to save even more energy.</br>To view this graph, first go to the Energy view for your site and pick an area.</p>

	<p>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img src="../images/release_notes/aug_2/4.png" id="num_1_5">
		</div>
	</p>

	<p>Then, for any zone in this area, click the down arrow on the right to expand the new energy graph.</p>

	<p>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img src="../images/release_notes/aug_2/5.png" id="num_1_6">
		</div>
	</p>

	<p>The graph shows the dim level for this zone over the past week.</p>

	<p>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img src="../images/release_notes/aug_2/7.png" id="num_1_7">
		</div>
	</p>

	<p>To zoom in on a particular area of the graph, drag the sliders (circled above) to the left/ right.</p>

	<p>You can see the peak areas in this graph are around noon on Tuesday and Wednesday. If these light levels are not needed, consider applying a schedule during these times to reduce consumption.</p>
